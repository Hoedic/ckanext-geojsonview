ckanext-geojsonview
===================

A simple Resource View extension for displaying GeoJSON resources in CKAN. Uses Leaflet.

Works in CKAN 2.3+. For equivalent functionality in older versions,
use the `nongeos` plugin of [ckanext-spatial](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial)

For a more powerful Resource View extension that uses OpenLayers and also displays
KML and a bunch of other good stuff, take a look at [ckanext-geoview](https://github.com/pduchesne/ckanext-geoview)
